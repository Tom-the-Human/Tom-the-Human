- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tom-the-Human.
- 👀 I’m interested in doing good in the world through the power of software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning <s>Java, front-end web dev, and game dev</s> Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other Launch School students on the Python track.
- 📫 How to reach me ... for now, just go through the contact link on my placeholder website: www.tomhodges.work - beware, it is UGLY and NEGLECTED.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My corn patch is nearly 10 feet tall! No, that's not a euphamism, I'm a gardener :)
